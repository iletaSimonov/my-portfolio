      <div class="current-job">
        <p>I am a Barista at a third-wave coffe house in Vancouver, Washington. I absolutely love working with coffee and making sure that I am serving the best possible cup to each of our guests! But I am ready to start my big-girl career in coding.

      <div class="education">
        <p>
          I graduated from Camas High School in 2013. At the time I had no idea what I wanted to do or where I wanted to go! But in 2020 I finally showed some interest in something. Coding! I started a web development class through Tacoma Community College, and unfortunately had to end the class due to Covid restrictions. But, I am so happy to be back in the swing of things, learning code through Epidcodus!

          I can't say I have a lot of <em>interesting</em> interests, but there are some!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I love to snowboard</li>
          <li>Drawing pictures is so relaxing, but I <em>have</em> to be in the right mood to do it.</li>
          <li>I love shopping to decorate my space. Because my space makes me comfortable.</li>
          <li>
            TikTok! I don't post anything, but I love scrolling through videos, and I learn a lot of tips and tricks from people around the world!
